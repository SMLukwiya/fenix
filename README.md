# fenixFourHourInternChallenge
This is a simple lightweight system that is intended to:
-Accrue points for each employee each month
-Track an employee’s “points balance” according to the number of points accrued, and the
 number of points used.
-Allow an employee to privately query their own points balance (allow for access controlled
 balance requests)
-allow for access controlled withdrawal requests with manager sign off trigger balance deduction and expense request creation    sent to finance
